## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document.
To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code.
You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

## vector of species:

hist(iris$Sepal.Length)

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## Control options

Each chunk has executable options: <https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html>

| Option    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `eval`    | Evaluate the code chunk (if `false`, just echos the code into the output).                                                                                                                        |
| `echo`    | Include the source code in output                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `output`  | Include the results of executing the code in the output (`true`, `false`, or `asis` to indicate that the output is raw markdown and should not have any of Quarto’s standard enclosing markdown). |
| `warning` | Include warnings in the output.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `error`   | Include errors in the output (note that this implies that errors executing code will not halt processing of the document).                                                                        |
| `include` | Catch all for preventing any output (code or results) from being included (e.g. `include: false` suppresses all output from the code block).                                                      |
